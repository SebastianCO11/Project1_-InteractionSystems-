## Project Description

This project involves re-editing the audio track of a movie trailer to completely change its genre and tone using Audacity audio editing software. The goal is to transform the original trailer's message and atmosphere through audio manipulation techniques, while keeping the video unchanged.

## Selected Trailer

**Original Trailer:** "Swiped" Official Trailer - Hulu
- **URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_F0owXLcnM
- **About the Movie:** "Swiped" is a biographical drama starring Lily James as Whitney Wolfe, the founder of the dating app Bumble. The film explores the real-life story behind the creation of one of the most popular dating platforms and is set to premiere on Hulu on September 19, 2025.
- **Original Genre:** Biographical Drama/Tech Startup Story

## Creative Approach

**Target Genre:** Comedy

**Concept:** Our re-edit transforms the serious biographical drama about digital dating innovation into a lighthearted comedy that promotes returning to traditional dating methods and eliminating dating apps like Tinder.

**Theme:** "Delete Tinder, Embrace Traditional Dating"

The audio editing approach focuses on:
